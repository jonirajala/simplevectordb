# simplevectordb

Building a simple vector database to learn it.

1. Turn data into vectors
2. Store vectors
3. Query vectors with algo


## Vectorizing
- Depends on the data i want to use
- Do I use ready vectorized data like word embeddings or vectorizer


## Storing
I need to store
- The vectors
- Metadata linked to each vector
- Data of each vector

## Algos
- KNNs
